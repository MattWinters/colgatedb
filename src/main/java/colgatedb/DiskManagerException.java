 * The contents of this file are either wholly the creation of Michael Hay or are
 * a significant adaptation of code from the SimpleDB project.  A number of
 * substantive changes have been made to meet the pedagogical goals of the cosc460

 * grateful for Sam's permission to use and adapt his materials.

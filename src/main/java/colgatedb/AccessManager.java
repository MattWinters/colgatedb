 * <p>
 * ColgateDB was developed by Michael Hay but borrows considerably from past
 * efforts including SimpleDB (developed by Sam Madden at MIT) and its predecessor
 * Minibase (developed at U. of Wisconsin by Raghu Ramakrishnan).
 * <p>
 * The contents of this file are either wholly the creation of Michael Hay or are
 * a significant adaptation of code from the SimpleDB project.  A number of
 * substantive changes have been made to meet the pedagogical goals of the cosc460
 * course at Colgate.  If this file contains remnants from SimpleDB, we are
 * grateful for Sam's permission to use and adapt his materials.

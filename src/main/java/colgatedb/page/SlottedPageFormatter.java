/**
 * SlottedPageFormatter is responsible for translating a SlottedPage to and from a
 * byte array representation.
 * <p>
 * A SlottedPage has an array of slots, each of which can hold one tuple and all tuples have the same exact size,
 * that is determined by the TupleDesc for this page.
 * <p>
 * The page format has three components:
 * (a) header
 * (b) payload
 * (c) zeroed out excess bytes
 * The header is a bitmap, with one bit per tuple slot. If the bit corresponding to a particular slot is 1, it
 * indicates that the slot is occupied; if it is 0, the slot is considered empty.
 * <p>
 * The layout of the header requires some explanation.  The first byte of the header represents slots 0..7, the second
 * byte is slots 8..15, and so on.  However, within a byte, the least significant bit of represents the lowest slot
 * value. Thus, suppose the first byte looked like this:
 * bits:  10010110
 * this indicates that slots 1, 2, 4, and 7 are occupied and slots 0, 3, 5, and 6 are empty.  In other words, the bits
 * for the slots are arranged according to following pattern:
 *
 * 7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0  15,14,13,12,11,10,9,8  23,22,21,20,19,18,17,16  and so on.
 *
 * <p>
 * The payload is the data itself.  The tuples of the page are written out in slot order from slot 0 to slot N-1 where
 * N is the number of slots on the page.  If the slot is occupied, the bytes for that slot consist of the data for each
 * field in th tuple, written out in order.  Let k be the number of bytes required to store a tuple.  If the slot is
 * empty slot, then k bytes of zeros are written out.
 * <p>
 * After the last slot is written, there may be excess bytes.  These are just zeroed out.
